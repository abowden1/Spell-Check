Project to implement a spell-checker that loads a dictionary and compares words against a provided text file.
Project is for PSET5 of Harvard's CS50
CS50 provides all but the implementation of dictionary.c. This I implemented myself.

While the project correctly and efficiently spell-checks the provided .txt documents, there is some leaking of memory in the "Check()"
function. Hopefully this will be resolved soon.
